# Landing-page
## Project Summary
This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare
you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This
project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.

Building a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content
that is added to the page.

## Method
- HTML/CSS, Javascript
- DOM
